# HC04-IoT-Project
In this project, a very simple IoT project is achieved. The primary aim of this project is to be able to calculate a simple numerical variable
via any kind of sensor and publish it to MQTT server. For this purpose, HC-04 ultrasonic distance sensor had been used with Raspberry PI and a simple Android app
has been created for data presentation.
